This report outlines a comprehensive security gap analysis of GridLink’s Operational Technology (OT) environment, identifying key vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.

Key Activities:
  - Purdue Model Mapping: Mapped GridLink’s OT infrastructure to the Purdue Model to identify appropriate segmentation and network boundaries.
  - NIST SP 800-82r3 Compliance: Assessed security gaps and recommended solutions based on NIST SP 800-82r3 standards for OT security.
  - Vulnerability Management: Evaluated existing patch management practices and the hardening of critical OT assets, such as servers and networking devices.
  - Incident Response Readiness: Reviewed GridLink's OT incident response plan and provided recommendations to enhance security monitoring and log collection across all OT systems.
  - Network Segmentation: Identified gaps in network segmentation, particularly between critical OT systems like DMS (Distribution Management System) and EMS (Energy Management System), and provided risk-based prioritization for remediation.

This project demonstrates my ability to assess OT environments, identify critical security gaps, and recommend improvements based on industry-standard frameworks.
